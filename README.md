# Microsoft Fabric Trivia Challenge

A sample quiz application for supervised event kiosks. Players answer Microsoft Fabric questions against the clock, earn time through streaks, and review incorrect answers.

The application uses React and TypeScript, Rayfin Functions, a Fabric SQL database, and Fabric Real-Time Intelligence for telemetry.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This version requires the Rayfin preview in Microsoft Fabric. Run the complete game in a Fabric deployment. Local builds and tests are supported; local gameplay and offline operation are not. This is a replacement for the earlier .NET and Cosmos DB implementation, not an in-place data migration.

## Overview

The sample demonstrates a React application backed by Rayfin Functions, transactional Fabric SQL storage, and Eventstream telemetry delivered to Eventhouse. Function invocation relies on Fabric gateway authentication, not the browser's sign-in controls.

- Play a timed quiz using touch, mouse, or the keyboard.
- Create question pools and import questions from UTF-8 CSV files.
- Sign in each kiosk operator with their own Fabric account. Attendees do not need Fabric accounts.
- Create pseudonymous adventurers using generated names, private return codes, and three-rune spells.
- Save game results in SQL and analyze events in Eventhouse.

Question banks, players, and saved games live in the application's **SQL database**. Analytics events live in the **KQL database** under Eventhouse. The repository does not include a Power BI report or an anonymous report-embedding service.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 and npm.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- A Fabric workspace with supported capacity and access to the Rayfin preview, Functions, SQL database, Eventstream, and Eventhouse.
- Permission to deploy the app and analytics resources, plus administrator help to authorize a dedicated SQL application identity.

Command examples use Bash. On Windows, use Git Bash or WSL.

### Set up the application

1. Clone the repository and install both sets of dependencies using [Deploy the application](docs/deployment.md#1-install-dependencies-and-the-cli).
2. Follow the rest of the deployment guide to deploy the app, connect analytics, and configure backend credentials. Deployment creates or updates billable cloud resources.
3. Open `https://<your-app-host>/operator`. Select **Sign in operator with Fabric**, then **Load questions and create pools**.
4. Follow [Prepare and import questions](docs/questions.md). Use [examples/questions.csv](examples/questions.csv) or select **Use sample questions** to start with four questions. Preview and confirm the import; questions are not loaded automatically.
5. Follow [Run a kiosk](docs/operations.md) to assign a station ID and complete a game with each operator account before admitting attendees.

### Player flow

New adventurers choose a country or region and three different runes in order. Registration reveals a generated name and a private four-character code. The code is shown only on this confirmation screen. Players keep their code and spell, then select **Begin trivia**.

Returning adventurers enter their masked code and the same rune sequence. After a game, wait for the result to finish saving before selecting **Play Again**.

The app does not request names or contact details from attendees. Generated identities, selected countries, and linked gameplay remain pseudonymous data. Review access, retention, and public-reporting requirements before collecting or publishing them.

## Development

After installing dependencies, run these checks from the repository root:

```bash
npm run build
npm run build:functions
npm run schema:check
npm test
npm run lint
```

`npm run dev:frontend` serves the UI at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`, without working Fabric sign-in or gameplay. `npm run dev` starts a Fabric-backed Rayfin workflow that can change cloud resources. Use a dedicated test workspace, not an event workspace.

See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for targeted tests, editable country and name lists, and documentation requirements.

## Limitations

- This sample is designed for supervised kiosks, not adversarial or prize-bearing competitions. The browser receives answer keys and controls the game timer.
- A code and rune spell identify a returning adventurer. They do not prove a person's identity or enforce one entry per person.
- All authorized operator sessions can load questions. The app has no separate question-administrator role.
- Active games and pending writes are held in browser memory. Refreshing or closing a tab cannot resume them.
- Telemetry is best effort. A saved SQL result does not guarantee delivery to a report.
